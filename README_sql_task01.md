# 🎓 SQL JOIN Practice — Student-Course Dataset

Welcome to the SQL JOIN practice project built during my **CODTECH Internship**. This project demonstrates practical usage of SQL JOINs on two relational tables: `Students` and `Courses`.

## 📘 Project Description

The objective of this task is to apply SQL JOIN operations on real-world-style academic data. It involves retrieving insights by combining two related tables — one for students and another for courses.

This project helps solidify understanding of:
- Data relationships
- Various JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Handling NULLs in queries
- Query logic construction and result analysis

## 🔍 SQL Queries Demonstrated

### ✅ INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
INNER JOIN Courses C ON S.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
🧠 *Returns only students enrolled in a course (matched CourseIDs).*

---

### ✅ LEFT JOIN
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
LEFT JOIN Courses C ON S.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
🧠 *Returns all students. CourseName will be NULL for those not enrolled.*

---

### ✅ RIGHT JOIN
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
RIGHT JOIN Courses C ON S.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
🧠 *Returns all courses. StudentName will be NULL for courses without enrolled students.*

---

### ✅ FULL OUTER JOIN (via UNION)
```sql
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
LEFT JOIN Courses C ON S.CourseID = C.CourseID
UNION
SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
RIGHT JOIN Courses C ON S.CourseID = C.CourseID;
```
🧠 *Returns all students and all courses, matched or unmatched.*

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred SQL IDE
2. Execute `sql_task01.sql` to create tables and insert data
3. Run JOIN queries individually to see results

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Solid understanding of JOIN operations
- Real-world data modeling experience
- Ability to analyze mismatches (NULL handling)
- Confidence in writing professional SQL
